# Project State

## Current phase

Shopify-native storefront and catalog readiness. The Nawadir Dior supplier architecture and all
Supabase-based Calapres architecture are retired.

## Approved architecture

    owner approval -> Shopify draft -> product review -> Shopify publication

Shopify is the operational source of truth. GitHub `main` is the technical source of truth for the
theme, decisions, and sanitized handoffs. There is no external product database, authentication
service, storage service, catalog queue, or mandatory orchestration layer.

## Verified repository state — 2026-07-29

### GitHub

- Canonical repository: `A-awd/calapres`.
- Canonical branch: `main`.
- Verified clean baseline before the retirement change:
  `b225b9643f8dc9a765ec99a305d969d7a558cf6d`.
- The legacy React and Vite application was not part of the Shopify theme deployment path and has
  been removed from the current tree.
- Supabase configuration, migrations, functions, generated types, client SDK dependency, and lock
  files have been removed.
- The retired supplier, n8n, and Supabase synchronization source and its CI workflow have been
  removed.
- A Shopify-only CI workflow checks the theme and blocks runtime Supabase reintroduction.
- Historical code remains recoverable from Git and must not be restored into the active tree.

### Shopify theme

- The active repository surface is the Shopify theme under `assets`, `config`, `layout`, `locales`,
  `sections`, `snippets`, and `templates`.
- Those theme directories contain no Supabase dependency.
- The existing deployment workflow does not depend on Supabase.
- The live theme is still ahead of `main`; theme-source reconciliation remains a separate task.

### Live Shopify

- Four products were last verified as drafts with inventory 0.
- The three burner drafts have media; the customizable stand draft does not.
- No product was published as part of the Supabase retirement work.
- Agentic catalog access, policies, Knowledge Base, FAQs, collections, and storefront settings are
  unaffected by this repository cleanup.
- Shopify product drafts may now proceed through direct Shopify review. No external database record
  or queue is required.

### Retired external systems

- Supabase is not an approved Calapres dependency and must not be queried during normal work.
- No external Supabase project or historical data was deleted. Permanent data deletion is a
  separate irreversible action requiring exact owner authorization.
- Live n8n was audited read-only. The saved Calapres Supabase credential has eight dependent
  workflows, and all eight are archived and inactive.
- No active workflow uses the Calapres Supabase credential. The credential itself remains saved;
  deleting it is a separate irreversible credential action requiring confirmation at deletion
  time.
- The repository no longer carries a Supabase or supplier n8n implementation.

## Remaining blockers

1. The four Shopify drafts still need owner-approved inventory, final product data, and publication
   decisions; the stand also needs approved media.
2. Saudi compliance still needs the verified legal entity name, commercial-register number, VAT
   number if applicable, verified phone, and complaint-response commitments.
3. The live theme must be reconciled into `main` before theme-code changes are deployed safely.
4. The public free-shipping announcement still needs a fresh render check for the saved SAR 320
   threshold.
5. Opening a new market remains a commercial decision.
6. The dormant Calapres Supabase credential in n8n may be deleted after explicit confirmation;
   all workflows that reference it are already archived.

## Next safe action

Review the four draft products directly in Shopify. Complete their media, price, inventory,
collections, SEO, and sales-channel settings; obtain the owner's publication approval; then publish
and verify them in Shopify and Shopify Catalog.

## Constraints

Never restore Supabase, the retired React application, a supplier crawler, or the retired
synchronization code. Never invent legal identity, inventory, pricing, media, or commercial terms.
Never overwrite the live theme until its newer source is reconciled into `main`.

## Theme delivery — 2026-07-31

- The Kimi-approved Calabriz static design (7 pages) is fully ported to a Shopify Liquid theme on `shopify-theme` (merge `65a5388`): dynamic products/variants, AJAX cart, engraving line item property «نص الحفر», and an editor-managed hero video.
- CI deploys `shopify-theme` only to the unpublished staging theme; the live theme stays untouched until the owner reviews the staging preview and publishes manually from Shopify Admin.
